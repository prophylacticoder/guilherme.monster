            <h1>Hi! I'm <strong>Guilherme.</strong></h1>

            <p>I'm a brazillian software engineer and self-improvement junkie.</P>

            <p>I currently work at <a href="https://genoacapital.com.br">Genoa Capital</a> where I create crawlers and automate complex backoffice's tasks for the company. I also work alongside Risk Team developing full-stack projects for displaying important data for the company.</p>

            

            <p>Besides self-improvement and programming, I'm beginning my undergrads in datascience in 2023 and I'm also interested in creating value and long-lasting positive impact in our society.</p>

            <p>I have been learning programming since I was 13-years-old.
                I began working as a software engineer in 2021.
                Today I feel comfortable programming in C, Python and Golang,
                I also have a grasp on front-end(HTML, CSS and JS).</p>

            <p>I enjoy sharing knowledge with humanity therefore I created a blog
                on Medium if you want to check it out click <a href="https://medium.com/@guilhermeluisd" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <p>If you wanna contact me you can find my info on the contact page.</p>

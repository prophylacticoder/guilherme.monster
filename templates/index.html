            I'm a brazillian software engineer and self-improvement junkie.
            <br>
            <br>
            I currently work at Genoa Capital, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Where I develop software for automatizing finantial market tasks.
            My previous work was with GoLang where I gave maintenance for a blockchain finantial system.
            <br>
            <br>
            Besides self-improvement and programming, I'm also interested in creating value and long-lasting positive impact in our society.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been learning programming since I was 13-years-old.
            I began working as a software engineer in 2021.
            Today I feel comfortable programming in C, Python and Golang,
             I also have a grasp on front-end(HTML, CSS and JS).
             <br><br>

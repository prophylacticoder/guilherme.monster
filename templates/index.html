                <h1 class="header-one">Hi! I'm <span style="font-weight: 700;">Guilherme.</span></h1>

                I identify myself as <span style="font-weight: 700;">he/him</span>.

                <p>I'm a brazillian software engineer and self-improvement junkie.</P>

                <p>I currently work at Genoa Capital, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Where I develop software for automatizing finantial market tasks.
                    My previous work was with GoLang where I gave maintenance for a blockchain finantial system.</p>

                <p>Besides self-improvement and programming, I'm also interested in creating value and long-lasting positive impact in our society.</p>

                <p>I have been learning programming since I was 13-years-old.
                    I began working as a software engineer in 2021.
                    Today I feel comfortable programming in C, Python and Golang,
                    I also have a grasp on front-end(HTML, CSS and JS).</p>

                <p>I enjoy sharing knowledge with humanity therefore I created a blog
                    on Medium if you want to check it out click <a href="https://medium.com/@guilhermeluisd" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
